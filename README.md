## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of the analysis was to create a macro that would be easily accessible for Steve, or any other end-user to utilize.  Specifically, we were looking at 12 different stocks that Steve's parents were thinking about investing in. We wanted to see the total volume of each stock (meaning how often each stock was traded) from the beginning to the end of the year for the years we have data on, which are 2017 and 2018.  Additonally we wanted to see the percentage return for each of the 12 stocks over a year long period.  By doing this analysis, Steve will be somewhat better able to recommend which of those stocks his parents should invest in, since apparently putting their money in an S&P 500 index fund or something isn't what they're looking for.

### Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

### Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
